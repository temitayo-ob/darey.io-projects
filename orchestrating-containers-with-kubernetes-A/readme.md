# ORCHESTRATING CONTAINERS ACROSS MULTIPLE VIRTUAL SERVERS WITH KUBERNETES.

In this project, you will continue building upon your containerization skills, and begin to work on industry tools that fit for production deployment.

Containers are the most lightweight and easily transferrable workloads, they start faster than VMs, consume less space and memory and, they perfectly fit to accommodate microservice architecture. It means that number of containers will be usually significantly higher that number of VMs and with number comes complexity of managing containers.

To manage a fleet of containers you can use different software solutions, but the most widely used one is Kubernetes (also referred as K8s). It was originally developed by Google and now being maintained by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

Why has it become so popular? It is a powerful Swiss-army knife when it comes to managing multiple containers in production-grade solutions.

For now we will not list down all the features and benefits of Kubernetes, you can watch this overview video to get to know more, but you certainly must have this tool in your DevOps arsenal and know when and how to use if for production-grade deployments.

This project is the first of a series Kubernetes-related practice projects, so get ready to become a professional containers’ fleet "pilot"*.

*Kubernetes (κυβερνήτης, Greek for "helmsman" or "pilot" or "governor", and the etymological root of cybernetics)

## Why migrate from Docker Compose to K8s

In the previous project you successfully deployed your Docker containers using Docker Compose, it is a great tool that helps avoiding execution of multiple CLI commands by preparing a declarative configuration file. It is handy when you deploy one or a few containers, but in most cases, it does not fit for production deployments.

Because of the many limitations that Docker Compose has, it is very important for us to consider migrating our solution to more an advanced technology. The most common alternatives to Compose, amongst a few others, are Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.

## What is wrong with Docker Compose?

It is important to understand that, DevOps is about "Culture" and NOT "Tools" Therefore, it is not correct to say that one tool is better than another; different organizations have different needs and a good tool for one team may be bad for another just because their needs are not the same. In some teams, Docker Compose fit their needs perfectly, despite the perceived limitations. The major limitation of Docker Compose is that it can only be used to run workloads on a single computer host. Now, that is an obvious limitation because if our Tooling Application and its MySQL Database are all running on a single VM, like we did in Project 20, then this host is considered as a SPOF (i.e. – Single Point Of Failure).

So, could we say there is something wrong with Docker Compose? Not exactly, as a matter of fact, it is being used a lot in the industry. It fits well into some use cases that require speedy development and Proof of Concepts. As you will soon see, Kubernetes is a lot more complex technology, and it may be an overkill for some use cases.

## Container Orchestration with Kubernetes

### What is Container Orchestration?

Two important things to remember about Docker containers are:

1. Unlike virtual machines, they are not designed to run for a very long time. By design, Docker containers are ephemeral. By “ephemeral” it means that a container can be stopped and destroyed, and a new one can be built from the same Docker image and put in place with an absolute minimum set-up and configuration requirement.

2. To ensure that container workloads are highly scalable, they must be configured to run across multiple compute nodes. A compute node can be a physical server or a virtual machine with Docker engine installed to run your containers.

If we had two compute nodes to run our containers, let us consider a following scenarios:

1. Given the two points mentioned above, if containers are configured to run across 2 computer nodes, and a particular container, running on Node 1 dies, how will it know that it can spin up again on Node 2?

2. Let us imagine that Tooling website container is running on Node 1, and MySQL container is running on Node 2, how will both containers be able to communicate with each other? Remember in Project 20, we had to create a custom network on the same host and ensure that they can communicate through that network. But in the case of 2 separate hosts, this is natively not possible.

Container orchestration is a concept that allows to address these two scenarios, it provides automation of all the aspects of coordinating and managing containers. Container orchestration is focused on managing life cycle of containers and their dynamic environments.

It is about automating the entire lifecycle of containers running across multiple nodes:

- Configuring and scheduling of containers on nodes
- Ensuring the availability of containers, even when they die
- Scaling of containers to equally balance application workloads across infrastructure
- Allocation of resources between containers
- Load balancing, traffic routing and service discovery of containers
- Health monitoring of containers
- Securing the interactions between containers.

Kubernetes is a tool designed to do Container Orchestration and it does its job very well when correctly configured.

As mentioned earlier, there are other alternatives to Docker Compose. But, throughout the entire PBL program, we will not focus on Docker Swarm. We will rather spend more time with Kubernetes. Part of the reason for this is because Kubernetes has more functionalities and is widely in use in the industry.

### KUBERNETES ARCHITECTURE

Kubernetes is a not a single package application that you can install with one command, it is comprised of several components, some of them can be deployed as services, some can be also deployed as separate containers.

Let us take a look at Kubernetes architecture diagram below:

![kubernetes2](./images/kubernetes2.png)

Make sure you understand the role of each component on the diagram above, without this understanding it will be extremely difficult for you to install and operate a K8s cluster, especially when it comes to troubleshooting and maintenance.

As an IT professional in general, you shall be comfortable using official documentation for tools you use, in case of Kubernetes – it has a very well structured and comprehensive documentation portal with multiple configuration code snippets. We strongly encourage you to add it to your bookmarks and refer to it every time you have a K8s-related question.

### Kubernetes From-Ground-Up

So far, Kubernetes sounds like a lot of fun, right? With its intuitive architecture, and rich configuration options, you may already want to jump right in, spin up a few VMs and begin to install and configure a Kubernetes cluster. But hold on for a second. Installing and configuring Kubernetes is far from being a walk in the park, i.e., it is very difficult to implement and get it ready for production. Especially, if you want to setup a highly available, and secure Kubernetes cluster.

The good news is, there are open-source tools available today that already has all the hard work done and you can plug into them easily. An example of that is minikube, which can be used during testing and development.

For a better understanding of each aspect of spinning up a Kubernetes cluster, we will do it without any automated helpers. You will install each and every component manually from scratch and learn how to make them work together – we call this approach "K8s From-Ground-Up".

To successfully implement "K8s From-Ground-Up", the following and even more will be done by you as a K8s administrator:

1, Install and configure master (also known as control plane) components and worker nodes (or just nodes).
2. Apply security settings across the entire cluster (i.e., encrypting the data in transit, and at rest)
- In transit encryption means encrypting communications over the network using HTTPS
- At rest encryption means encrypting the data stored on a disk
3. Plan the capacity for the backend data store etcd
4. Configure network plugins for the containers to communicate
5. Manage periodical upgrade of the cluster
6. Configure observability and auditing

Note: Unless you have any business or compliance restrictions, ALWAYS consider to use managed versions of K8s – Platform as a Service offerings, such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) as they usually have better default security settings, and the costs for maintaining the control plane are very low.

You will be able to appreciate automation tools and managed versions of Kubernetes much more after you have experienced all the lessons from the struggles and failures from the "K8s From-Ground-Up".

### Let us begin building out Kubernetes cluster from the ground

Tools to be used and expected result of the Project 20

- VM: AWS EC2
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 lts+
- Docker Engine
- kubectl console utility
- cfssl and cfssljson utilities
- Kubernetes cluster

You will create 6 EC2 Instances, and in the end, we will have the following parts of the cluster properly configured:

- Three Kubernetes Master
- Three Kubernetes Worker Nodes
- Configured SSL/TLS certificates for Kubernetes components to communicate securely
- Configured Node Network
- Configured Pod Network

## STEP 1-INSTALL CLIENT TOOLS BEFORE BOOTSTRAPPING THE CLUSTER.

First, you will need some client tools installed and configurations made on your client workstation (wsl ubuntu 20.04):

- awscli – is a unified tool to manage your AWS services
- kubectl – this command line utility will be your main control tool to manage your K8s cluster. You will use this tool so many times, so you will be able to type ‘kubetcl’ on your keyboard with a speed of light. You can always make a shortcut (alias) to just one character ‘k’. Also, add this extremely useful official kubectl Cheat Sheet to your bookmarks, it has examples of the most used ‘kubectl’ commands.
- cfssl – an open source toolkit for everything TLS/SSL from Cloudflare
- cfssljson – a program, which takes the JSON output from the cfssl and writes certificates, keys, CSRs, and bundles to disk.

### Install and configure AWS CLI

On your local workstation (ubuntu 20.04) download and install the latest version of AWS CLI

To install awscli on your ubuntu local system:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install awscli -y
sudo apt install jq -y
```

Configure AWS CLI to access all AWS services used, for this you need to have a user with programmatic access keys configured in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

Generate access keys and store them in a safe place.

To configure your AWS CLI – run your shell (or cmd if using Windows) and run:

```
aws configure --profile <your_username>
AWS Access Key ID [None]: <access key>
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <secret key>
Default region name [None]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]: json
```

![configure](./images/configure.png)

Test your AWS CLI by running:

`aws ec2 describe-vpcs`

and check if you can see VPC details.

![describe](./images/describe.png)

### Install kubectl

Kubernetes cluster has a Web API that can receive HTTP/HTTPS requests, but it is quite cumbersome to curl an API each and every time you need to send some command, so kubectl command tool was developed to ease a K8s administrator’s life.

With this tool you can easily interact with Kubernetes to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, view logs and perform many more administrative operations.

### Linux Or Windows using Gitbash or similar tool 

Download the binary

`wget https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.21.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl`

Make it executable

`chmod +x kubectl`

Move to the Bin directory

`sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/`

Verify that kubectl version 1.21.0 or higher is installed:

`kubectl version --client`

![kubectl](./images/kubectl.png)

### Install CFSSL and CFSSLJSON-linux

cfssl is an open source tool by Cloudflare used to setup a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI Infrastructure) for generating, signing and bundling TLS certificates. In previous projects you have experienced the use of Letsencrypt for the similar use case. Here, cfssl will be configured as a Certificate Authority which will issue the certificates required to spin up a Kubernetes cluster.

Download, install and verify successful installation of cfssl and cfssljson:

```
wget -q --show-progress --https-only --timestamping \
  https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssl_linux-amd64 \
  https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssljson_linux-amd64
```

```
chmod +x cfssl_linux-amd64 cfssljson_linux-amd64
sudo mv cfssl_linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cfssl
sudo mv cfssljson_linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cfssljson
```

Verification. Verify cfssl version 1.2.0 or higher is installed:

`cfssl version`

![cfssl](./images/cfssl.png)


## AWS CLOUD RESOURCES FOR KUBERNETES CLUSTER

As we already know, we need some machines to run the control plane and the worker nodes. In this section, you will provision EC2 Instances required to run your K8s cluster. You can use Terraform for this. But it is highly recommended to start out first with manual provisioning using awscli and have thorough knowledge about the whole setup. After that, you can destroy the entire project and start all over again using Terraform. This manual approach will solidify your skills and give you the opportunity to face more challenges.

### Step 2 – Configure Network Infrastructure

### Virtual Private Cloud – VPC

1. Create a directory named k8s-cluster-from-ground-up

`mkdir k8s-cluster-from-ground-up`

2. Create a VPC and store the ID as a variable:

```
VPC_ID=$(aws ec2 create-vpc \
--cidr-block 172.31.0.0/16 \
--output text --query 'Vpc.VpcId'
)
```
3. Tag the VPC so that it is named:

`NAME=k8s-cluster-from-ground-up`

```
aws ec2 create-tags \
  --resources ${VPC_ID} \
  --tags Key=Name,Value=${NAME}
```

4. Enable DNS support for your VPC:

```
aws ec2 modify-vpc-attribute \
--vpc-id ${VPC_ID} \
--enable-dns-support '{"Value": true}'
```

5. Enable DNS support for hostnames:

```
aws ec2 modify-vpc-attribute \
--vpc-id ${VPC_ID} \
--enable-dns-hostnames '{"Value": true}'
```

![vpc](./images/vpc.png)

### AWS Region

6. Set the required region

`AWS_REGION=us-east-2`

### Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol – DHCP

7. Configure DHCP Options Set:

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol networks for automatically assigning IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices connected to the network using a client–server architecture.

AWS automatically creates and associates a DHCP option set for your Amazon VPC upon creation and sets two options: domain-name-servers (defaults to AmazonProvidedDNS) and domain-name (defaults to the domain name for your set region). AmazonProvidedDNS is an Amazon Domain Name System (DNS) server, and this option enables DNS for instances to communicate using DNS names.

By default EC2 instances have fully qualified names like ip-172-50-197-106.eu-central-1.compute.internal. But you can set your own configuration using an example below.

```
DHCP_OPTION_SET_ID=$(aws ec2 create-dhcp-options \
  --dhcp-configuration \
    "Key=domain-name,Values=$AWS_REGION.compute.internal" \
    "Key=domain-name-servers,Values=AmazonProvidedDNS" \
  --output text --query 'DhcpOptions.DhcpOptionsId')
```

8. Tag the DHCP Option set:

```
aws ec2 create-tags \
  --resources ${DHCP_OPTION_SET_ID} \
  --tags Key=Name,Value=${NAME}
```

9. Associate the DHCP Option set with the VPC:

```
aws ec2 associate-dhcp-options \
  --dhcp-options-id ${DHCP_OPTION_SET_ID} \
  --vpc-id ${VPC_ID}
```

### Subnet

10. Create the Subnet:

```
SUBNET_ID=$(aws ec2 create-subnet \
  --vpc-id ${VPC_ID} \
  --cidr-block 172.31.0.0/24 \
  --output text --query 'Subnet.SubnetId')
```

```
aws ec2 create-tags \
  --resources ${SUBNET_ID} \
  --tags Key=Name,Value=${NAME}
```

### Internet Gateway – IGW

11. Create the Internet Gateway and attach it to the VPC:

```
INTERNET_GATEWAY_ID=$(aws ec2 create-internet-gateway \
  --output text --query 'InternetGateway.InternetGatewayId')
aws ec2 create-tags \
  --resources ${INTERNET_GATEWAY_ID} \
  --tags Key=Name,Value=${NAME}
```

```
aws ec2 attach-internet-gateway \
  --internet-gateway-id ${INTERNET_GATEWAY_ID} \
  --vpc-id ${VPC_ID}
```

![igw](./images/igw.png)

### Route tables

12. Create route tables, associate the route table to subnet, and create a route to allow external traffic to the Internet through the Internet Gateway:

```
ROUTE_TABLE_ID=$(aws ec2 create-route-table \
  --vpc-id ${VPC_ID} \
  --output text --query 'RouteTable.RouteTableId')
aws ec2 create-tags \
  --resources ${ROUTE_TABLE_ID} \
  --tags Key=Name,Value=${NAME}
aws ec2 associate-route-table \
  --route-table-id ${ROUTE_TABLE_ID} \
  --subnet-id ${SUBNET_ID}
aws ec2 create-route \
  --route-table-id ${ROUTE_TABLE_ID} \
  --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0 \
  --gateway-id ${INTERNET_GATEWAY_ID}
```

![rt](./images/Rt.png)

### Security groups

13. Configure security groups

```
# Create the security group and store its ID in a variable
SECURITY_GROUP_ID=$(aws ec2 create-security-group \
  --group-name ${NAME} \
  --description "Kubernetes cluster security group" \
  --vpc-id ${VPC_ID} \
  --output text --query 'GroupId')

# Create the NAME tag for the security group
aws ec2 create-tags \
  --resources ${SECURITY_GROUP_ID} \
  --tags Key=Name,Value=${NAME}

# Create Inbound traffic for all communication within the subnet to connect on ports used by the master node(s)
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
    --group-id ${SECURITY_GROUP_ID} \
    --ip-permissions IpProtocol=tcp,FromPort=2379,ToPort=2380,IpRanges='[{CidrIp=172.31.0.0/24}]'

# Create Inbound traffic for all communication within the subnet to connect on ports used by the worker nodes
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
    --group-id ${SECURITY_GROUP_ID} \
    --ip-permissions IpProtocol=tcp,FromPort=30000,ToPort=32767,IpRanges='[{CidrIp=172.31.0.0/24}]'

# Create inbound traffic to allow connections to the Kubernetes API Server listening on port 6443
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id ${SECURITY_GROUP_ID} \
  --protocol tcp \
  --port 6443 \
  --cidr 0.0.0.0/0

# Create Inbound traffic for SSH from anywhere (Do not do this in production. Limit access ONLY to IPs or CIDR that MUST connect)
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id ${SECURITY_GROUP_ID} \
  --protocol tcp \
  --port 22 \
  --cidr 0.0.0.0/0

# Create ICMP ingress for all types
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id ${SECURITY_GROUP_ID} \
  --protocol icmp \
  --port -1 \
  --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

![sg](./images/sg1.png)
![sg](./images/sg2.png)

### Network Load Balancer

14. Create a network Load balancer

```
LOAD_BALANCER_ARN=$(aws elbv2 create-load-balancer \
--name ${NAME} \
--subnets ${SUBNET_ID} \
--scheme internet-facing \
--type network \
--output text --query 'LoadBalancers[].LoadBalancerArn')
```

### Tagret Group

15. Create a target group: (For now it will be unhealthy because there are no real targets yet.

```
TARGET_GROUP_ARN=$(aws elbv2 create-target-group \
  --name ${NAME} \
  --protocol TCP \
  --port 6443 \
  --vpc-id ${VPC_ID} \
  --target-type ip \
  --output text --query 'TargetGroups[].TargetGroupArn')
```

16. Register targets: (Just like above, no real targets. You will just put the IP addresses so that, when the nodes become available, they will be used as targets.)

```
aws elbv2 register-targets \
  --target-group-arn ${TARGET_GROUP_ARN} \
  --targets Id=172.31.0.1{0,1,2}
```


17. Create a listener to listen for requests and forward to the target nodes on TCP port 6443

```
aws elbv2 create-listener \
--load-balancer-arn ${LOAD_BALANCER_ARN} \
--protocol TCP \
--port 6443 \
--default-actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=${TARGET_GROUP_ARN} \
--output text --query 'Listeners[].ListenerArn'
```

### K8s Public Address

18. Get the Kubernetes Public address

```
KUBERNETES_PUBLIC_ADDRESS=$(aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers \
--load-balancer-arns ${LOAD_BALANCER_ARN} \
--output text --query 'LoadBalancers[].DNSName')
```

![all](./images/all1.png)

## STEP 3 – CREATE COMPUTE RESOURCES

### AMI

1. Get an image to create EC2 instances:

```
IMAGE_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-images --owners 099720109477 \
  --filters \
  'Name=root-device-type,Values=ebs' \
  'Name=architecture,Values=x86_64' \
  'Name=name,Values=ubuntu-pro-server/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-pro-server-20221202' \
  | jq -r '.Images|sort_by(.Name)[-1]|.ImageId')
```

ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-*

ubuntu-pro-server/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-pro-server-20221202

### SSH key-pair

2. Create SSH Key-Pair

```
mkdir -p ssh

aws ec2 create-key-pair \
  --key-name ${NAME} \
  --output text --query 'KeyMaterial' \
  > ssh/${NAME}.id_rsa
chmod 600 ssh/${NAME}.id_rsa
```

![all](./images/all2.png)

### EC2 Instances for Controle Plane (Master Nodes)

3. Create 3 Master nodes: Note – Using t2.micro instead of t2.small as t2.micro is covered by AWS free tier

```
for i in 0 1 2; do
  instance_id=$(aws ec2 run-instances \
    --associate-public-ip-address \
    --image-id ${IMAGE_ID} \
    --count 1 \
    --key-name ${NAME} \
    --security-group-ids ${SECURITY_GROUP_ID} \
    --instance-type t2.micro \
    --private-ip-address 172.31.0.1${i} \
    --user-data "name=master-${i}" \
    --subnet-id ${SUBNET_ID} \
    --output text --query 'Instances[].InstanceId')
  aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute \
    --instance-id ${instance_id} \
    --no-source-dest-check
  aws ec2 create-tags \
    --resources ${instance_id} \
    --tags "Key=Name,Value=${NAME}-master-${i}"
done
```

![master](./images/masternodes.png)

### EC2 Instances for Worker Nodes

4. Create 3 worker nodes:

```
for i in 0 1 2; do
  instance_id=$(aws ec2 run-instances \
    --associate-public-ip-address \
    --image-id ${IMAGE_ID} \
    --count 1 \
    --key-name ${NAME} \
    --security-group-ids ${SECURITY_GROUP_ID} \
    --instance-type t2.micro \
    --private-ip-address 172.31.0.2${i} \
    --user-data "name=worker-${i}|pod-cidr=172.20.${i}.0/24" \
    --subnet-id ${SUBNET_ID} \
    --output text --query 'Instances[].InstanceId')
  aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute \
    --instance-id ${instance_id} \
    --no-source-dest-check
  aws ec2 create-tags \
    --resources ${instance_id} \
    --tags "Key=Name,Value=${NAME}-worker-${i}"
done
```

![worker](./images/workernodes.png)

## STEP 4 - PREPARE THE SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY AND GENERATE TLS CERTIFICATES

The following components running on the Master node will require TLS certificates.

- kube-controller-manager
- kube-scheduler
- etcd
- kube-apiserver

The following components running on the Worker nodes will require TLS certificates.

- kubelet
- kube-proxy

Therefore, you will provision a PKI (public key infrastructure) Infrastructure using cfssl which will have a Certificate Authority. The CA will then generate certificates for all the individual components.

### Self-Signed Root Certificate Authority (CA)

Here, you will provision a CA that will be used to sign additional TLS certificates.

Create a directory and cd into it:

`mkdir ca-authority && cd ca-authority`

Generate the CA configuration file, Root Certificate, and Private key:

```
{

cat > ca-config.json <<EOF
{
  "signing": {
    "default": {
      "expiry": "8760h"
    },
    "profiles": {
      "kubernetes": {
        "usages": ["signing", "key encipherment", "server auth", "client auth"],
        "expiry": "8760h"
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF

cat > ca-csr.json <<EOF
{
  "CN": "Kubernetes",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "UK",
      "L": "England",
      "O": "Kubernetes",
      "OU": "DAREY.IO DEVOPS",
      "ST": "London"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

cfssl gencert -initca ca-csr.json | cfssljson -bare ca

}
```

The file defines the following:

```
CN – Common name for the authority

algo – the algorithm used for the certificates

size – algorithm size in bits

C – Country

L – Locality (city)

ST – State or province

O – Organization

OU – Organizational Unit
```

![cert](./images/ca-config.png)

List the directory to see the created files

![ls](./images/ls%20-ltr.png)

The 3 important files here are:

- ca.pem – The Root Certificate
- ca-key.pem – The Private Key
- ca.csr – The Certificate Signing Request

### Generating TLS Certificates For Client and Server

You will need to provision Client/Server certificates for all the components. It is a MUST to have encrypted communication within the cluster. Therefore, the server here are the master nodes running the api-server component. While the client is every other component that needs to communicate with the api-server.

Now we have a certificate for the Root CA, we can then begin to request more certificates which the different Kubernetes components, i.e. clients and server, will use to have encrypted communication.

Remember, the clients here refer to every other component that will communicate with the api-server. These are:

- kube-controller-manager
- kube-scheduler
- etcd
- kubelet
- kube-proxy
- Kubernetes Admin User

### Let us begin with the Kubernetes API-Server Certificate and Private Key

The certificate for the Api-server must have IP addresses, DNS names, and a Load Balancer address included. Otherwise, you will have a lot of difficulties connecting to the api-server.

1. Generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR), Private Key and the Certificate for the Kubernetes Master Nodes.

```
{
cat > master-kubernetes-csr.json <<EOF
{
  "CN": "kubernetes",
   "hosts": [
   "127.0.0.1",
   "172.31.0.10",
   "172.31.0.11",
   "172.31.0.12",
   "ip-172-31-0-10",
   "ip-172-31-0-11",
   "ip-172-31-0-12",
   "ip-172-31-0-10.${AWS_REGION}.compute.internal",
   "ip-172-31-0-11.${AWS_REGION}.compute.internal",
   "ip-172-31-0-12.${AWS_REGION}.compute.internal",
   "${KUBERNETES_PUBLIC_ADDRESS}",
   "kubernetes",
   "kubernetes.default",
   "kubernetes.default.svc",
   "kubernetes.default.svc.cluster",
   "kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local"
  ],
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "UK",
      "L": "England",
      "O": "Kubernetes",
      "OU": "DAREY.IO DEVOPS",
      "ST": "London"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

cfssl gencert \
  -ca=ca.pem \
  -ca-key=ca-key.pem \
  -config=ca-config.json \
  -profile=kubernetes \
  master-kubernetes-csr.json | cfssljson -bare master-kubernetes
}
```

### Creating the other certificates: for the following Kubernetes components:

- Scheduler Client Certificate
- Kube Proxy Client Certificate
- Controller Manager Client Certificate
- Kubelet Client Certificates
- K8s admin user Client Certificate

2. kube-scheduler Client Certificate and Private Key

```
{
cat > kube-scheduler-csr.json <<EOF
{
  "CN": "system:kube-scheduler",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "UK",
      "L": "England",
      "O": "system:kube-scheduler",
      "OU": "DAREY.IO DEVOPS",
      "ST": "London"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

cfssl gencert \
  -ca=ca.pem \
  -ca-key=ca-key.pem \
  -config=ca-config.json \
  -profile=kubernetes \
  kube-scheduler-csr.json | cfssljson -bare kube-scheduler

}
```
If you see any warning message, it is safe to ignore it.

3. kube-proxy Client Certificate and Private Key

```
{

cat > kube-proxy-csr.json <<EOF
{
  "CN": "system:kube-proxy",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "UK",
      "L": "England",
      "O": "system:node-proxier",
      "OU": "DAREY.IO DEVOPS",
      "ST": "London"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

cfssl gencert \
  -ca=ca.pem \
  -ca-key=ca-key.pem \
  -config=ca-config.json \
  -profile=kubernetes \
  kube-proxy-csr.json | cfssljson -bare kube-proxy

}
```

4. kube-controller-manager Client Certificate and Private Key

```
{
cat > kube-controller-manager-csr.json <<EOF
{
  "CN": "system:kube-controller-manager",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "UK",
      "L": "England",
      "O": "system:kube-controller-manager",
      "OU": "DAREY.IO DEVOPS",
      "ST": "London"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

cfssl gencert \
  -ca=ca.pem \
  -ca-key=ca-key.pem \
  -config=ca-config.json \
  -profile=kubernetes \
  kube-controller-manager-csr.json | cfssljson -bare kube-controller-manager

}
```

5. kubelet Client Certificate and Private Key

Similar to how you configured the api-server's certificate, Kubernetes requires that the hostname of each worker node is included in the client certificate.

Also, Kubernetes uses a special-purpose authorization mode called Node Authorizer, that specifically authorizes API requests made by kubelet services. In order to be authorized by the Node Authorizer, kubelets must use a credential that identifies them as being in the system:nodes group, with a username of system:node:{nodeName}. Notice the "CN": "system:node:${instance_hostname}", in the below code.

Therefore, the certificate to be created must comply to these requirements. In the below example, there are 3 worker nodes, hence we will use bash to loop through a list of the worker nodes’ hostnames, and based on each index, the respective Certificate Signing Request (CSR), private key and client certificates will be generated.

```
for i in 0 1 2; do
  instance="${NAME}-worker-${i}"
  instance_hostname="ip-172-31-0-2${i}"
  cat > ${instance}-csr.json <<EOF
{
  "CN": "system:node:${instance_hostname}",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "UK",
      "L": "England",
      "O": "system:nodes",
      "OU": "DAREY.IO DEVOPS",
      "ST": "London"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

  external_ip=$(aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=${instance}" \
    --output text --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].PublicIpAddress')

  internal_ip=$(aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=${instance}" \
    --output text --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].PrivateIpAddress')

  cfssl gencert \
    -ca=ca.pem \
    -ca-key=ca-key.pem \
    -config=ca-config.json \
    -hostname=${instance_hostname},${external_ip},${internal_ip} \
    -profile=kubernetes \
    ${NAME}-worker-${i}-csr.json | cfssljson -bare ${NAME}-worker-${i}
done
```

![cert](./images/cert.png)

6. Finally, kubernetes admin user's Client Certificate and Private Key

```
{
cat > admin-csr.json <<EOF
{
  "CN": "admin",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "UK",
      "L": "England",
      "O": "system:masters",
      "OU": "DAREY.IO DEVOPS",
      "ST": "London"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

cfssl gencert \
  -ca=ca.pem \
  -ca-key=ca-key.pem \
  -config=ca-config.json \
  -profile=kubernetes \
  admin-csr.json | cfssljson -bare admin
}
```
7. Actually, we are not done yet!

There is one more pair of certificate and private key we need to generate. That is for the Token Controller: a part of the Kubernetes Controller Manager kube-controller-manager responsible for generating and signing service account tokens which are used by pods or other resources to establish connectivity to the api-server. Read more about Service Accounts from the official documentation.

Alright, let us quickly create the last set of files, and we are done with PKIs

```
{

cat > service-account-csr.json <<EOF
{
  "CN": "service-accounts",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "UK",
      "L": "England",
      "O": "Kubernetes",
      "OU": "DAREY.IO DEVOPS",
      "ST": "London"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

cfssl gencert \
  -ca=ca.pem \
  -ca-key=ca-key.pem \
  -config=ca-config.json \
  -profile=kubernetes \
  service-account-csr.json | cfssljson -bare service-account
}
```

## STEP 5 – DISTRIBUTING THE CLIENT AND SERVER CERTIFICATES

Now it is time to start sending all the client and server certificates to their respective instances.

Let us begin with the worker nodes:

Copy these files securely to the worker nodes using scp utility

- Root CA certificate – ca.pem
- X509 Certificate for each worker node
- Private Key of the certificate for each worker node

scp for securely transfer files from one machine to another has the same format as ssh command

```
ssh -i <path to private key pair> <host machine username>@<host IP>

scp -i <path to private key pair> file1 file2 file3 <host machine username>@<host IP>:~/;
```

where ~/ is the choice directory where you want to send your files, in this case is the home directory

```
for i in 0 1 2; do
  instance="${NAME}-worker-${i}"
  external_ip=$(aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=${instance}" \
    --output text --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].PublicIpAddress')
  scp -i ../ssh/${NAME}.id_rsa \
    ca.pem ${instance}-key.pem ${instance}.pem ubuntu@${external_ip}:~/; \
done
```

![dist](./images/distributecert.png)

Master or Controller node: – Note that only the api-server related files will be sent over to the master nodes

```
for i in 0 1 2; do
instance="${NAME}-master-${i}" \
  external_ip=$(aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=${instance}" \
    --output text --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].PublicIpAddress')
  scp -i ../ssh/${NAME}.id_rsa \
    ca.pem ca-key.pem service-account-key.pem service-account.pem \
    master-kubernetes.pem master-kubernetes-key.pem ubuntu@${external_ip}:~/;
done
```

![dist](./images/distcertmaster.png)

The kube-proxy, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, and kubelet client certificates will be used to generate client authentication configuration files later.

## STEP 6 USE KUBECTL TO GENERATE KUBERNETES CONFIGURATION FILES FOR AUTHENTICATION

All the work you are doing right now is ensuring that you do not face any difficulties by the time the Kubernetes cluster is up and running. In this step, you will create some files known as kubeconfig, which enables Kubernetes clients to locate and authenticate to the Kubernetes API Servers.

You will need a client tool called kubectl to do this. And, by the way, most of your time with Kubernetes will be spent using kubectl commands.

Now it’s time to generate kubeconfig files for the kubelet, controller manager, kube-proxy, and scheduler clients and then the admin user.

First, let us create a few environment variables for reuse by multiple commands.

`KUBERNETES_API_SERVER_ADDRESS=$(aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --load-balancer-arns ${LOAD_BALANCER_ARN} --output text --query 'LoadBalancers[].DNSName')`

1. Generate the kubelet kubeconfig file

For each of the nodes running the kubelet component, it is very important that the client certificate configured for that node is used to generate the kubeconfig. This is because each certificate has the node’s DNS name or IP Address configured at the time the certificate was generated. It will also ensure that the appropriate authorization is applied to that node through the Node Authorizer.

Each kubeconfig outside of the master nodes like the kubelet, kube-proxy and admin requires a Kubernetes API Server to connect to while the ones within the control nodes just need to connect with the localhost (loop back) address. To support high availability the IP address assigned to the external load balancer fronting the Kubernetes API Servers will be used.

Below command must be run in the directory where all the certificates were generated.

```
for i in 0 1 2; do

instance="${NAME}-worker-${i}"
instance_hostname="ip-172-31-0-2${i}"

 # Set the kubernetes cluster in the kubeconfig file
  kubectl config set-cluster ${NAME} \
    --certificate-authority=ca.pem \
    --embed-certs=true \
    --server=https://$KUBERNETES_API_SERVER_ADDRESS:6443 \
    --kubeconfig=${instance}.kubeconfig

# Set the cluster credentials in the kubeconfig file
  kubectl config set-credentials system:node:${instance_hostname} \
    --client-certificate=${instance}.pem \
    --client-key=${instance}-key.pem \
    --embed-certs=true \
    --kubeconfig=${instance}.kubeconfig

# Set the context in the kubeconfig file
  kubectl config set-context default \
    --cluster=${NAME} \
    --user=system:node:${instance_hostname} \
    --kubeconfig=${instance}.kubeconfig

  kubectl config use-context default --kubeconfig=${instance}.kubeconfig
done
```

![all](./images/all3.png)

Open up the kubeconfig files generated and review the 3 different sections that have been configured:

- Cluster
- Credentials
- And Kube Context

Kubeconfig file is used to organize information about clusters, users, namespaces and authentication mechanisms. By default, kubectl looks for a file named config in the $HOME/.kube directory. You can specify other kubeconfig files by setting the KUBECONFIG environment variable or by setting the --kubeconfig flag.To get to know more how to create your own kubeconfig files – read this documentation -[here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/.)


Context part of kubeconfig file defines three main parameters: cluster, namespace and user. You can save several different contexts with any convenient names and switch between them when needed.

`kubectl config use-context <context-name>`

2. Generate the kube-proxy kubeconfig

```
{
  kubectl config set-cluster ${NAME} \
    --certificate-authority=ca.pem \
    --embed-certs=true \
    --server=https://${KUBERNETES_API_SERVER_ADDRESS}:6443 \
    --kubeconfig=kube-proxy.kubeconfig

  kubectl config set-credentials system:kube-proxy \
    --client-certificate=kube-proxy.pem \
    --client-key=kube-proxy-key.pem \
    --embed-certs=true \
    --kubeconfig=kube-proxy.kubeconfig

  kubectl config set-context default \
    --cluster=${NAME} \
    --user=system:kube-proxy \
    --kubeconfig=kube-proxy.kubeconfig

  kubectl config use-context default --kubeconfig=kube-proxy.kubeconfig
}
```

3. Generate the Kube-Controller-Manager kubeconfig

Notice that the --server is set to use 127.0.0.1. This is because, this component runs on the API-Server so there is no point routing through the Load Balancer.

```
{
  kubectl config set-cluster ${NAME} \
    --certificate-authority=ca.pem \
    --embed-certs=true \
    --server=https://127.0.0.1:6443 \
    --kubeconfig=kube-controller-manager.kubeconfig

  kubectl config set-credentials system:kube-controller-manager \
    --client-certificate=kube-controller-manager.pem \
    --client-key=kube-controller-manager-key.pem \
    --embed-certs=true \
    --kubeconfig=kube-controller-manager.kubeconfig

  kubectl config set-context default \
    --cluster=${NAME} \
    --user=system:kube-controller-manager \
    --kubeconfig=kube-controller-manager.kubeconfig

  kubectl config use-context default --kubeconfig=kube-controller-manager.kubeconfig
}
```

4. Generating the Kube-Scheduler Kubeconfig

```
{
  kubectl config set-cluster ${NAME} \
    --certificate-authority=ca.pem \
    --embed-certs=true \
    --server=https://127.0.0.1:6443 \
    --kubeconfig=kube-scheduler.kubeconfig

  kubectl config set-credentials system:kube-scheduler \
    --client-certificate=kube-scheduler.pem \
    --client-key=kube-scheduler-key.pem \
    --embed-certs=true \
    --kubeconfig=kube-scheduler.kubeconfig

  kubectl config set-context default \
    --cluster=${NAME} \
    --user=system:kube-scheduler \
    --kubeconfig=kube-scheduler.kubeconfig

  kubectl config use-context default --kubeconfig=kube-scheduler.kubeconfig
}
```

5. Finally, generate the kubeconfig file for the admin user

Configuring kubectl for Remote Access

In this lab you will generate a kubeconfig file for the kubectl command line utility based on the admin user credentials.

The Admin Kubernetes Configuration File: Each kubeconfig requires a Kubernetes API Server to connect to. To support high availability the IP address assigned to the external load balancer fronting the Kubernetes API Servers will be used.

```
{
  kubectl config set-cluster ${NAME} \
    --certificate-authority=ca.pem \
    --embed-certs=true \
    --server=https://${KUBERNETES_API_SERVER_ADDRESS}:6443 \
    --kubeconfig=admin.kubeconfig

  kubectl config set-credentials admin \
    --client-certificate=admin.pem \
    --client-key=admin-key.pem \
    --embed-certs=true \
    --kubeconfig=admin.kubeconfig

  kubectl config set-context default \
    --cluster=${NAME} \
    --user=admin \
    --kubeconfig=admin.kubeconfig

  kubectl config use-context default --kubeconfig=admin.kubeconfig
}
```

TASK: Distribute the files to their respective servers, using scp and a for loop like we have done previously. This is a test to validate that you understand which component must go to which node.

```
for i in 0 1 2; do
  instance="${NAME}-worker-${i}"
  external_ip=$(aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=${instance}" \
    --output text --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].PublicIpAddress')
  scp -i ../ssh/${NAME}.id_rsa \
    ${instance}.kubeconfig kube-proxy.kubeconfig ubuntu@${external_ip}:~/; \
done
```

```
for i in 0 1 2; do
instance="${NAME}-master-${i}" \
  external_ip=$(aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=${instance}" \
    --output text --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].PublicIpAddress')
  scp -i ../ssh/${NAME}.id_rsa \
    kube-scheduler.kubeconfig kube-controller-manager.kubeconfig admin.kubeconfig ubuntu@${external_ip}:~/;
done
```

![cert](./images/dist1.png)

## STEP 7 PREPARE THE ETCD DATABASE FOR ENCRYPTION AT REST.

Kubernetes uses etcd (A distributed key value store) to store variety of data which includes the cluster state, application configurations, and secrets. By default, the data that is being persisted to the disk is not encrypted. Any attacker that is able to gain access to this database can exploit the cluster since the data is stored in plain text. Hence, it is a security risk for Kubernetes that needs to be addressed.

To mitigate this risk, we must prepare to encrypt etcd at rest. "At rest" means data that is stored and persists on a disk. Anytime you hear "in-flight" or "in transit" refers to data that is being transferred over the network. "In-flight" encryption is done through TLS.

### Generate the encryption key and encode it using base64

`ETCD_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64) `

See the output that will be generated when called. Yours will be a different random string.

`echo $ETCD_ENCRYPTION_KEY`

## Create an encryption-config.yaml file as documented officially by kubernetes

```
cat > encryption-config.yaml <<EOF
kind: EncryptionConfig
apiVersion: v1
resources:
  - resources:
      - secrets
    providers:
      - aescbc:
          keys:
            - name: key1
              secret: ${ETCD_ENCRYPTION_KEY}
      - identity: {}
EOF
```

![key](./images/encryption%20key.png)

Send the encryption file to the Controller nodes using scp and a for loop.

```
for i in 0 1 2; do
instance="${NAME}-master-${i}" \
  external_ip=$(aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=${instance}" \
    --output text --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].PublicIpAddress')
  scp -i ../ssh/${NAME}.id_rsa \
    encryption-config.yaml ubuntu@${external_ip}:~/;
done
```

![encrypt](./images/encryption-config-yaml.png)
