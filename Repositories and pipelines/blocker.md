Jenkins not executing jobs (build executor offline, pending - waiting for next executor)

Solution
go to Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> Nodes -> Built-In Node -> Configure

Examine the "Number of executors". (Click on configure icon)

The number of executors was set to 0. Increased it and issue got fixed.

You should also explore the JCasC section and see all the configured credentials and pipelines.

You can now create more secrets to connect to other tools, such as Sonarqube, AWS, KUBECONFIG etcâ€¦

Now, attempt to configure a remote artifactory repository.

1. Create a remote repository in Artifactory, so that instead of pulling helm charts directly from https://charts.jenkins.io for example, you will pull directly from your configured remote repository in Artifactory. This helps organisations stay secure. Artifactroy will therefore be a proxy to pulling from the internet.

2. Configure remote repository for the following chart repos, search the repos and try to install tools from them through the Artifactroy remote repository you have configured.
